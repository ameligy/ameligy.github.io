<p>Nov. 13 - Nov. 17 2023; this week was reading week with no classes, but was not a pause in my learning journey. I was fully immersed in the <a href="https://ucalgary.ca/writing-symbols/community/indigenous-relations" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Indigenous Relations Training Program</a> (IRTP), a unique initiative that interweaves professional and personal development (24 hours of non-credit Professional Development). From Tuesday to Friday, I spent each day from 9 AM to 4 PM on the main UCalgary campus, participating in the program as part of <a href="https://www.redevelop.ca/the-redevelop-challenge-2023-24/">REDEVELOP</a>, followed by a debrief session scheduled on Saturday (Nov. 18th).</p>

<p>The IRTP stands out for its commitment to authentic, immersive learning experiences. With Indigenous program facilitators and Elders at the helm, the program offered a rare opportunity to delve deep into Indigenous perspectives and wisdom. This enriching experience, which I plan to detail in a separate blog post, has been both enlightening and transformative. I intended to share this reflection earlier, but there is so much impactful knowledge to capture from my 4 day training and I want to ensure that I do it right. I also want to receive consent from all educators prior to sharing thereby I think it is only feasible to finalize during the winter break at the semester’s end.</p>

<p>Amidst this enriching IRTP experience, the academic rigors of the program continued. Nov. 17th was the deadline for submitting the comprehensive policy recommendation report that was a focal point of my Week 11 <a href="https://ahmedelmeligy.com/2023/11/13/ucalgary-mpp-week-11-reflection/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reflection</a>. Additionally, my ambition to commence research for my Competitive Policy term paper, which accounts for a substantial 40% of my course grade, had to be momentarily shelved. This captures the challenge with course-based graduate programs: balancing a multitude of deliverables and competing priorities within a limited timeframe, all while endeavoring to grow personally in areas outside of academia.</p>
