<p>Sept. 18 – 23 2023; It's astonishing how time flies! This week, I delved into the microeconomics concepts of competitive and absolute advantage. An intriguing point I noted is that once extraneities are monetized, they transition into private gains, much like the benefits seen in CSR (Corporate Social Responsibility) initiatives.</p>

<p>We had the privilege of hearing from a pollster and a local media reporter as guest speakers in our PPOL 619: Governance, Institutions, and Public Policy lecture. Their discussions emphasized the dichotomy between politics and policy: while politics revolves around winning elections, policy focuses on crafting and implementing effective rules and regulations. Pollsters play a pivotal role in this ecosystem by gauging public opinions, which subsequently aids politicians in formulating policies. Their data not only directs the initial policy development but also monitors its execution. A key takeaway from the media perspective was the view that politics represents the exercise of power, while the media provides the context which policies are crafted and executed.</p>

The film underscores the disconnect and confusion regarding climate change. Amidst the overwhelming emotions of anger, greed, and division, the film posits a challenge: to set aside ingrained biases and to engage with the multifaceted challenges of climate change.</p>

<p>The film's emphasis on the psychological facets of climate change resonated deeply with me. It's evident that many, including STEM professional, struggle to fully comprehending the intricacies of climate change data. Director Tom Acton's perspective on accentuating the positive strides being made in the climate change narrative, as opposed to the prevailing doom and gloom, truly struck a chord.</p>
