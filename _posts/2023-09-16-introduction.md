<p>I'm a commercially-savvy process engineer with a history of envisioning and operationalizing large-scale performance improvement initiatives in Alberta's oil &amp; gas sector. With over 5 years of experience in engineering, I have acquired an insiderâ€™s view on daily operations across production, safety, and reliability, and am well-versed with working in diverse teams to launch turnarounds that unlock greater efficiency and profitability. I have worked in downstream (oil refinery) and upstream (oil sands open-pit mine).</p>

<p>In addition to my expertise in operations and finance, I excel in relationship management and spearheading change. My leadership has been demonstrated through involvement in numerous extracurricular initiatives, including United Way campaign chair and steering a task force focused on employee engagement while working from home during the initial response to COVID-19.</p>

<p>Throughout these endeavors, as well as a variety of volunteer roles, I have fostered and sustained profound relationships across a range of disciplinary units. My approach has always been to advocate vigorously for the interests of my team, bringing to the table innovative, high-quality program ideas. Furthermore, I have played an instrumental role in annual budgeting and forecasting processes, ensuring collaboration and consensus across diverse stakeholders.</p>

<p>While I take pride in my technical engineering achievements, which have contributed to supplying high-quality fuel products to Canadians, I am now prepared to shift my focus towards public policy to tackle the most pressing challenge of my generation: climate change. I am excited about contributing to solutions by leveraging my oil and gas experience to influence global energy policy changes. Currently, I am enrolled in the Master of Public Policy (MPP) program at the University of Calgary, with an anticipated graduation date of August 2024.</p>
