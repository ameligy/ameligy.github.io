<li><strong>Define the Problem</strong>: This involves clearly articulating the issue in question. Instead of jumping to solutions or getting overwhelmed with the complexity of the situation, it's crucial to concisely describe the problem. A well-defined problem guides the subsequent steps in the analysis and ensures that any solutions proposed directly address the core issue.</li>

<li><strong>Assemble Some Evidence</strong>: This could involve collecting data, reviewing existing research, or sourcing opinions from subject matter experts. It is important to recognize that this step is costly, therefore we need to be very diligent with ensuring that the next incremental piece of data is truly worth the effort and aligns with the project's timeline. Collaborating with experts, especially data analysts, to transition from data to information to evidence can help us understand the problem's scale, depth, and subtleties.</li>

<li><strong>Construct the Alternatives:</strong>&nbsp;This involves brainstorming and identifying potential policy solutions that address the given problem. It's essential to also consider the “do nothing” approach or “let present trends continue”, to serve as a benchmark against other alternatives. "Appendix A – Things Governments Do" is a resource I intend to delve deeper into, I aim to highlight notable examples of such government actions from both Canadian and International contexts. I also plan to supplement it with additional levers not currently mentioned throughout my MPP journey to ultimately create a personalized reference for my public policy career.</li>

<li><strong>Select the Criteria:</strong>&nbsp;This involves setting standards to evaluate the outcome of policy alternatives to determine their success or failure. These standards might encompass factors like cost-effectiveness, timeliness, feasibility, equity, legality, and potential side effects.</li>

<li><strong>Project the Outcomes</strong>: This involves making informed predictions about the consequences of each alternative.&nbsp;Bardach considers this the most challenging step, due to the unpredictability of the future. I found the outcome matrix to be a useful tool, as it ensures all alternatives are measured against the same criterion and presented in a digestible manner.</li>

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li><strong>Confront the Trade-offs:&nbsp;</strong>This involves weighing the trade-offs to determine which outcome provides the most net benefit or least harm. Note that this is done&nbsp;across projected outcomes and not policy alternatives/solutions. It is prudent to establish a base case projected outcome for which everything will be compared against. I think of this as normalizing the projected outcomes to allow for “apples to apples” comparison.</li>

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li><strong>Decide:&nbsp;</strong>Time to decide! Sometimes the more we know the more uncertain we become, as finding a perfect policy solution is challenging, if not impossible. Thereby need to decide on a preferred policy alternative&nbsp;while weighing the client’s values and political realities.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li><strong>Tell Your Story:&nbsp;</strong>This involves effectively communicating the policy analysis. This ensures decision-makers can easily understand and be persuaded by the findings to expediate the decision-making process.</li>
