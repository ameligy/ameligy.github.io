<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Jan. 08 – Jan. 12 2024;&nbsp;as we step into the second week of the second semester at UCalgary's MPP program, it's almost surreal to realize we're beyond the halfway mark of this academic journey. We will still be working on our capstone project during the summer but there will be not be courses/class time.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The pace has quickened, with a semester schedule that's noticeably more packed than the first semester for me, due to the data policy elective I've decided to audit, alongside two 2-hour weekly working sessions for the REDEVELOP project. Despite the intensifying workload, the structure of the week afforded me a three-day weekend with Friday off.</p>

<p><strong>Data and Public Policy</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Our introductory week in PPOL699: Data and Public Policy was marked by an overview of the texts that will guide our discussions throughout the semester. The selected books:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Amanda Clarke's Opening the Government of Canada (2019), a critical exploration of transparency and governance in the digital age.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Brian Christian's The Alignment Problem: Machine Learning and Human Values (2021), delves into the ethical quandaries at the intersection of artificial intelligence and human preferences.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Kate Crawford's Atlas of AI: Politics, and the Planetary Costs of Artificial Intelligence (2022), a comprehensive examination of AI's impact on society and the environment.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Jennifer Pahlka's Recoding America: Why Government Is Failing in the Digital Age and How We Can Do Better (2023), sheds light on the systemic challenges facing digital governance and public administration in the United States.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item --></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The course promises a deep dive into the data pipeline, encompassing Data Collection, Data Management, Analytics, and Visualization. Through group discussions, we aim to unpack the authors' intentions  to develop an understanding of the evolving digital landscape and how it interact with public policy.</p>

<p><strong>Politics and Strategy</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Our discussions in PPOL607: Politics and Strategy ventured into the intricacies of the policy cycle, focusing on the roles we play and the impact of various actors, institutions, and ideas. A particularly engaging concept was the "Goldilocks Option" the notion that humans gravitate towards a middle path when presented with a range of choices. This concept resonated with my experiences as a project engineer, where the presentation of options often followed a pattern: </p>

<!-- wp:list {"ordered":true} -->
<ol><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>do-nothing (status quo) approach</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>a lead option based on thorough analysis</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>one or two additional alternatives.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item --></ol>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This framework not only aids in decision-making but also enhances client management. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>We then delved into the art of aligning project proposals with client perspectives, employing strategic language to foster dialogue. Phrases like, "Based on my research, does this align with your understanding and perspective?" and inquiries for feedback on presented options, mirror the consultative approach I encountered as a process engineer. This reflection underscored the importance of effective communication in building and maintaining professional relationships. My previous experiences, interacting daily with stakeholders from diverse backgrounds, have been instrumental in honing these skills. I'm thankful for those opportunities, as they've significantly shaped my approach to relationship building and client management in complex engineering initiatives.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Equally enriching is the plan of focusing on writing and public speaking in our tutorials. The emphasis on impromptu speaking has particularly resonated with me, bringing back valuable memories of my time with Toastmasters and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bpsAIk3cEl0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">improv</a> groups. </p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Expanding Decision-Making Horizons</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In PPOL609: Decision Analysis, we revisited themes from PPOL602: Markets and Public Policy, delving deeper into the dichotomy of objective versus subjective reasoning in decision-making. The course is structured to refine our ability to distinguish and structure the objective elements of decision-making, providing a framework for clearer, more effective choices rooted in cost-benefit analysis.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Exploring the Frontiers of Energy and Climate Policy</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>SDEV633: Energy and Climate Policy course is designed to immerse us in the complexities of environmental governance and sustainable development. The course's format includes weekly quizzes and pre-class readings, along with weekly guest speakers to share their expertise on a specific policy area.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The instructors expect us to draft briefing notes for three select (our discretion) lectures. This exercise is designed to synthesize the main takeaways and reflections, fostering a critical engagement with the material. To guide our analysis, we were introduced to the PESTLE$$ model—an analytical framework encompassing Political, Environmental, Social, Technical, Legal, Economic, and Fiscal dimensions by a guest lecturer. This model serves as a comprehensive lens through which we can evaluate policy implications, ensuring our briefing notes are not only reflective but also grounded in a multi-dimensional understanding of policy impacts.</p>

<p><strong>Reflections on Public Finances </strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Transitioning to PPOL615: Public Finances, the third economics-focused course in the program (and my fourth, considering PPOL699: Competitive and Regulatory Policy elective I took in the fall semester), I've begun to notice overlapping themes and concepts. Despite this, the course offers a valuable deep dive into the microeconomic functions of government, exploring resource allocation, income distribution, and the intricate balance between efficiency and social policy. </p>
