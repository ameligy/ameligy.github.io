<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Nov. 06 – Nov. 10 2023; we wrapped up the second and final block week of our PPOL 600: The Study of Public Policy course (introduced in my Week 1 <a href="https://ahmedelmeligy.com/2023/09/19/ucalgary-mpp-week-1-reflection/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reflection</a>).<br><br>The engagement reached new heights with our case week. Our simulation case study, centered around the intricate and timely issue of immigration policy. Our agenda included scheduled meetings with <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/news/2017/06/biography_-_neilyeates.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Neil Yeates</a>, UCalgary School of Public Policy (SPP) Executive Fellow in residence, offering invaluable opportunities for guidance, questions, and feedback. Each group was tasked with a challenging yet stimulating assignment: a 15-minute briefing presentation on the case topic, followed by a 15-minute discussion and feedback session on Nov. 9. </p>

<p>The class was divided into 8 groups, each embarking on a unique path. Four groups delved into enhancing the components of the Temporary Foreign Worker (TFW) and short-stay visa programs, viewing them through the lens of Alberta's specific needs and challenges. The other four groups embarked on an equally ambitious task – developing an Immigration Levels Plan for 2024-2026. The week's activities culminated in a collective effort to compile a comprehensive policy recommendation report by Nov. 17.</p>

<p>We had presentations Monday and Tuesday mornings from 9 AM to 12 PM, dedicated Wednesday entirely to group work, and then engaged in all-day group presentations on Thursday. The afternoons and evenings were filled with extensive group work, often stretching late into the evening. It was a opportunity to to present our case study briefings to an esteemed panel of 'cabinet ministers', including both retired and current high-ranking government officials with diverse backgrounds in federal and provincial departments, as well as the private sector.</p>

<p>This exercise was more than an academic endeavor; it was a realistic simulation of the policy-making process, demanding a blend of research, critical analysis, and practical solution-finding. The week proved to be an immersive journey into the realm of public policy, particularly the multifaceted world of immigration policy, reinforcing the importance of informed, empathetic, and strategic policy development.</p>
