<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Assignment:</strong> The following policy brief was based on a fictional problem statement from the film Wall-E, submitted on Sept. 15 2023. The intent of this assignment was to get familiar with Bardach's Eightfold Path framework to conduct policy analysis without getting occupied with the data gathering and analysis, thereby all figures presented herein are fictional and from my imagination.</p>

<p><strong>To:</strong> Captain B. McCrea, Leader of "Operation Recolonize"</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Subject:</strong> Addressing Overconsumption and Facilitating Successful Recolonization of Earth</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Issue: </strong>Earth is uninhabitable due to excessive pollution caused by unchecked overconsumption that led to overwhelming waste accumulation, estimated to be 150 billion tons of municipal solid waste. Considering the recent discovery of life on Earth and the inception of "Operation Recolonize", it is necessary to create policies that foster sustainable living and a successful inhabitation within the next 15 years per Captain B. McCrea’s directive.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Background: </strong>Buy n Large Corporation (BnL) directors gave citizens the right to spend and buy with no limits, thereby the Earth has been plagued by pollution resulting from decades of unchecked consumerism by 2105. Earth’s population reached 200 billion and BnL has assumed control of the planet’s economy and resource management by the early 21<sup>st</sup> century. It is estimated that total municipal solid waste reached 150 billion tons by 2105, approximately 75 times the levels of the early 2000s.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Axiom and other starships were created and launched in 2105 to house people comfortably on a temporary basis away from Earth, with plans to return home through "Operation Recolonize" once "Operation Cleanup" succeeded. However, by 2110 Earth's condition worsened with rising toxin levels and failing Waste Allocation Load Lifter Earth-Class (Wall-E) units, the CEO of BnL, Shelby Forthright, abandoned future recolonization plans through the confidential A113 Directive.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Current Status: </strong>In 2805, towering piles of garbage fill the landscapes, and the environment appears devoid of life. After a 700-year search, the Extra-Terrestrial Vegetation Evaluator (EVE) successfully locates vegetation on Earth. This discovery inspires Captain B. McCrea to initiate "Operation Recolonize", a monumental endeavor aimed at restarting life on Earth.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Currently, the Axiom's citizens live a life of leisure, with service robots attending to all their needs. The younger generation grows up learning that BnL is their "very best friend," a belief reinforced through ubiquitous holographic advertisements promoting consumption at every turn of the starship. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Axiom’s citizens general sentiment towards "Operation Recolonize" is predominately cautious optimism, with 44% of respondents expressing this view per Figure 1, as they grapple with the emerging reality of breaking free from the cycle of consumption and stepping into a new beginning on Earth.&nbsp; While some exhibit curiosity and excitement, fueled by Captain B. McCrea's passionate exclamation "I don't want to survive, I want to live!", the majority remain apprehensive as they grew up accustomed to the comfort and safety.</p>

<!-- wp:list {"ordered":true,"type":"1"} -->
<ol style="list-style-type:1"><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li><em><u>Maintaining the status quo</u></em>. Although it is the path of least resistance as it promises continuity and comfort, it fails to tackle the root cause of the problem that led to Earth's current state. Thereby risking Captain B. McCrea’s objective of fostering habitable home planet and hampering the success of “Operation Recolonize”.</li>

It involves using Axiom’s service robots to recommission out of service Wall-E units, build housing and transport garbage to outer space. Additionally, a smaller subset of the service robots will assist in practical learning and community-building activities. However, this strategy demands a substantial lifestyle change from Axiom's citizens, challenging deeply entrenched habits nurtured over centuries by BnL's propaganda.</span></li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li><em><u>Intensive research &amp; development program on pollution elimination technologies.</u></em><strong><em> </em></strong>This involves building research hubs on the Axiom and strategic locations on Earth, fostering innovation and driving economic growth through sustainable industries. This strategy involves significant challenges including time constraints, substantial resource allocation, and unpredictable outcomes. Based on preliminary estimates the outcomes will not be realized for 20 years.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item --></ol>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Recommendation: </strong>Considering the gravity of the issue and the urgency to facilitate a successful recolonization within 15 years, <em>educational campaign and repurposing of service robots</em> policy option is recommended. This recommendation seeks to resonate with Captain B. McCrea’s aspiration of not just surviving, but truly living, encapsulating the vibrant spirit of community within the next 12 years. Maintaining the status quo is not an appropriate policy alternative as it does not address the root cause, while an intensive R&amp;D program does not meet the timeline set forth.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The strategy recommended herein encourages responsible consumption, fosters community building and active participation in the recolonization process, and provides the roadmap to actively clean-up the planet. A phased approach would be adopted, starting with a comprehensive educational campaign focused on sustainable living and reduced consumption habits. Followed by the repurposing of service robots to assist with recommissioning Wall-E units, practical learning and community-building activities, building housing and transporting garbage to outer space as depicted in Figure 2.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>To ensure the success of this policy option, it is essential for Captain B. McCrea to actively engage the key stakeholders namely, Axiom’s citizens and BnL Corporation. It is recommended to establish bi-weekly townhalls where citizens can voice their opinions, suggestions, and concerns, thereby encouraging active participation and ownership of the recolonization process. Additionally, bringing BnL on board as a partner to leverage their technological prowess and resources in facilitating the transformation. BnL would be mandated to shift its business model to focus on sustainable products and services, aligning its mission statement with the objectives of "Operation Recolonize".</p>
