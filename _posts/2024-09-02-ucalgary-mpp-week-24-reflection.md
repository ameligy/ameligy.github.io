<p>Feb. 19 - Feb. 23 2024; 8th week of the winter semester and reading week.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I am catching up on my reflections blog posts at the end of the summer (with all my MPP degree requirments finished). It has been a busy winter, spring, and summer season for me. I have taken notes throughout the year so it is somewhat easy to be doing this.</p>

<p><strong>Flight Training</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Reading week gave me a chance to catch up on my flight training. I also completed my private pilot license check ride (road test for pilots), which I passed successfully!</p>

<p><strong>Public Policy Special Event</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I had the opportunity to attend an energy transition roundtable. The event was titled “Seizing Opportunities in the Energy Transition.” It took place on February 21, 2024, at the University of Calgary School of Public Policy. I was a note taker. I worked with a team of 6 members. The team was composed of MPP faculty, research associate, staff, and student colleague. The intent was to compile a proceeding <a href="https://journalhosting.ucalgary.ca/index.php/sppp/article/view/79597/57602" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">paper </a>to capture the discussions and opinions expressed during the event. It was an insightful dicussion with experts/representatives from government, non-profit, industry and academia. My two take aways:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul class="wp-block-list"><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Lots of opportunities exist (recommend reading the proceeding paper; its an easy read)</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Canada/Alberta is too bullish on Hydrogen. I personally don't think it will get us anywhere. I will break this down more in future blog posts.</li>

<p><strong>Internship Interviews</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I had an interview with Government of Alberta's <a href="https://www.alberta.ca/executive-council" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Executive Council</a> part of Alberta Policy Internship Program (APIP). APIP is a six-month experiential learning opportunity. Executive council supports the Premier and Ministries across government with effective strategic planning and coordinated policy development. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>During the interview, I gained insights into the operations and daily responsibilities within the Executive Council. This heightened my excitement for the role. I'm awaiting feedback next week on the next steps.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>After nearly six years in the private sector, I see this as the perfect next step. I believe it will complete my public policy learning. I’m looking forward to gaining firsthand government experience and witnessing decision-making at the highest level in the provincial government.</p>
