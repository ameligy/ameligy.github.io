<p>As I step into the second and final semester of my Master of Public Policy journey at the University of Calgary, I'm filled with anticipation and a sense of purpose. This semester, spanning from January 2nd to May 10th, 2024, promises a diverse and challenging curriculum.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The semester is packed with both mandatory courses and electives, carefully chosen to broaden my understanding and skills in various policy areas:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Two courses will be taught in an intensive block week format:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li><strong>PPOL617: Regulation and the Law</strong> will kick off the year, running from January 02 - 06 (Tuesday to Saturday), as January 1st is a statutory holiday.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li><strong>PPOL604: Communicating Policy</strong> is scheduled towards the semester's end after final exams, from May 06 - 10 (Tuesday to Saturday), bridging the winter and spring sessions.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item --></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>With just two days off each week, my schedule will be tightly packed. These days will be crucial for keeping up with the substantial reading workload, which is more intensive than in the first semester. Additionally, I’ll be dedicating time to the REDEVELOP program and advancing my Capstone project. My goal is to leverage this semester not only for academic growth but also to set the stage for a full-time role or an internship in the summer. As I embark on this final semester, I'm eager to dive deep into these diverse subjects, each promising to add a unique dimension to my policy toolkit. </p>
