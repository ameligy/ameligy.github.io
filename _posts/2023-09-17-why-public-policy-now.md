<p>I graduated from uOttawa with a Chemical Engineering degree May 2018. I right away started working at the Centre for Research in Photonics for the summer of 2018 with Dr. Pierre Berni designing portable microfluidic systems. The objective was to utilize them for detection of disease in biofluids using long-range surface plasmon-polariton waveguides. A special shout-out to Jesse for flagging this incredible opportunity!</p>

<p>During that time I knew I wanted to work professionally as an engineer-in-training as I needed a break from the academic setting. I thought I would have a relatively easy time during my job search, as I <a href="https://www.soci.org/news/awards/sci-canada-awards/canada-student-merit-award/ahmed-elmeligy-biography">graduated</a> with the highest academic standing in the department (surpassing 100 other graduates in 2018) and having a 1-year co-op work experience under my belt. But I was wrong, it certainly was a challenging time. I was applying to 5-10 jobs daily, and ended up with 3 interviews after the end of the summer, none of which materialized into a job offer.</p>

<p>When I hit the 300th job application, I decided to relocate back to Edmonton, where I have previously lived and worked in 2016 for my co-op term. My logic was once the address on my resume reads Edmonton, AB, recruiters would be more inclined to give me an interview as majority of chemical engineering jobs at the time were in western Canada (BC &amp; AB). Although this didn't exactly pan out as envisioned; the first month yielded a single interview, which, regrettably, did not result in a job offer.</p>

<p>During this period, I was on a post-graduate work permit, narrowing my options of potentially going back to my co-op term employer, Imperial Oil. Given Imperial’s policy of hiring only citizens and permanent residents — a policy that changed, unbeknownst to me. Towards the end of the summer of 2018 the Human Rights Tribunal of Ontario <a href="https://www.thestar.com/news/gta/rights-tribunal-slams-imperial-oil-for-cancelling-job-offer-to-engineer-over-immigration-status/article_d7669766-17d5-5222-a5b1-22185e3f234b.html">ruled</a> that an employer cannot discriminate against job candidates who do not have Canadian permanent residence status or citizenship. Receiving this news in September through a former colleague and friend, David, I seized the opportunity to apply at Imperial, leading to a job offer to work at an oil refinery in Edmonton, with a start date of January 7, 2019.</p>

<p>I had the immense privilege of working and learning alongside industry leaders at an organization that prioritized safety and valued its people above all — a stance that I greatly appreciate. Over a span of three years, I undertook a variety of roles in Edmonton before transitioning to a role in an oil sands project in northern Alberta with Imperial. This position operated on a rotating schedule, with two weeks on and two weeks off. Seizing the opportunity to enhance my work-life balance, I relocated to Calgary to make good use of my time off in the mountains!</p>

<p>Around the third-year mark at Imperial in 2022, I deeply pondered my future career trajectory. Despite being viewed as a high performer with executive potential, I came to the realization that continuing as an engineer wasn't aligning with my true calling. While I harbor great pride in my contributions to  provide Canadians with high-quality fuel products, I felt a more pressing mission calling me.</p>

<p>I had a deep desire to contribute meaningfully to the fight against climate change, a goal I felt was constrained by the limited scope within the oil and gas sector and my employer's fence line. As I projected the trajectory of my career, I foresaw my sphere of influence growing significantly, albeit within the confined boundaries of the company's focus/mission. This realization brought a troubling foresight: climbing the corporate ladder could mean witnessing a critical window of opportunity slip away, a time frame wherein substantial change could be effected. I feared that with each step upward, the pressing issue of climate change would continue to escalate, potentially reaching a point of no return before I could leverage a position of substantial influence for greater change.</p>

<p>I started researching for alternative career options and I came across energy public policy, to my surprise there seemed to be few professionals in the field with a technical background (STEM). This revelation illuminated a potential niche for me, a space where I could carve out a meaningful role, leveraging my technical expertise to bridge this gap. Additionally, I have always enjoyed tackling complex problems that revolve around people and systems, rather than just focusing on the technical aspect — even though I exhibited a strong knack for it.</p>

<p>Fueled by a desire to be at the forefront of creating meaningful solutions, I envisioned utilizing my extensive experience in the oil and gas sector to influence global energy policy changes. I guess you will find out how I do if I keep blogging haha.</p>
