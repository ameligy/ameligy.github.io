<p>The final step of my Master of Public Policy (MPP) program at the University of Calgary, is the completion of a capstone project.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This blog post is my capstone project knowledge mobilization item,  which is a formal requirement. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I am immensely grateful to my supervisor, Dr. Megan R. Bailey, for her invaluable guidance throughout this process, as well as to my wife and family for their unwavering support. Their encouragement has been vital in reaching this milestone.</p>

<p>The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change’s (IPCC) <a href="https://www.ipcc.ch/sr15/download/">Special Report</a> on Global Warming of 1.5 ⁰C highlights the urgency of achieving global net-zero greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by 2050, to mitigate the most severe effects of climate change.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In response, nations worldwide are intensifying their pursuit of sustainable energy solutions to reach this net-zero target.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This includes transforming electricity systems from relying on few large centrally controlled fossil fuel generators to many smaller renewable sources, with the reduction in solar and wind generation costs.</p>

<p>In 2023, global spending on solar power <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/solar-power-due-overtake-oil-production-investment-first-time-iea-2023-05-25/#:~:text=In%202023%2C%20solar%20power%20spending,as%20a%20true%20energy%20superpower.">exceeded investment in oil production</a> for the first time, marking a significant shift in energy priorities. This follows a 24 per cent increase in clean energy investments over two years, outpacing the 15 per cent rise in fossil fuel investments.</p>

<p>As Alberta pushes forward with its goals to <a href="https://www.alberta.ca/emissions-reduction-and-energy-development-plan">achieve net-zero by 2050</a>, the integration of renewable energy into the existing electricity grid has become a critical challenge.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>While the province has experienced remarkable growth of renewable generation with installed capacity doubling from 2020 to 2023 (refer to Figure 1), the underlying transmission infrastructure—built primarily for centralized fossil fuel plants—lags.</p>

<p>This mismatch threatens the stability and reliability of energy supply, creating an urgent need for comprehensive policy solutions.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Alberta is blessed with abundant renewable resources, but these resources are located far from the urban centers that need them most. For instance, the wind farms in southern Alberta have the potential to generate significant clean energy, but without robust transmission lines, delivering this power to cities like Calgary and Edmonton becomes a daunting challenge.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>To address these issues, my research examines several key policy areas identified in the province’s Ministry of Affordability and Utilities' October 2023 Transmission <a href="https://ablawg.ca/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Transmission-Policy-Green-Paper-2023.pdf">Green Paper</a>.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The green paper outlines the current challenges and suggests areas for reform, such as generator transmission contribution, line loss calculation methodology, zero-congestion policy, and cost allocation.</p>

<p>I am Ahmed Elmeligy, a Master of Public Policy (MPP) candidate at the University of Calgary, class of 2024. I offer seven actionable policy recommendations for reforming transmission policy as part of my capstone project, "Optimizing Transmission Infrastructure for Renewable Energy Integration in Alberta".</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>My recommendations include the implementation of a tiered Generating Unit Owner's Contribution (GUOC) system. This system would provide financial relief to smaller renewable energy developers, encouraging their participation in the market and promoting a more decentralized energy grid. I also recommend adopting a system-wide average approach for line loss calculation.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I advocate for the adoption of a flexible congestion policy to replace the current zero-congestion mandate. By allowing limited grid congestion, the province can reduce the need for costly infrastructure investments while still maintaining grid reliability. I suggest that the ministry considers conducting a cost-benefit analysis on the proposed transmission cost allocation models, including a novel progressive model that incorporates generator cost flow-through mitigations.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I call for enhanced intertie utilization, improving connections with neighboring provinces, particularly British Columbia. This would allow Alberta to tap into hydroelectric power and stabilize its energy supply. This supports the province’s net-zero aspiration and ensures that consumers benefit from affordable and reliable electricity.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The recommendations I propose aim to enhance investment certainty and promote competition in variable renewable energy generation, to create a resilient and sustainable electricity system that can meet the demands of tomorrow. I encourage you to read my full capstone report (to be linked once uploaded).</p>
