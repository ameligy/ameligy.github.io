<p>Dec. 11– Dec. 15 2023; time to showcase what I have learnt this semester in the final exam week. I reflect on a week that not only tested my knowledge but also expanded my understanding of contemporary policy challenges. </p>

<p>Final exam week brought its usual mix of anticipation and intensity. I sat for two exams in PPOL699: Competitive Policy and PPOL602: Markets and Public Policy. I was quite pleased with rounding off the semester with four As and achieving a 4.0 GPA (grades came out end of December). This achievement fuels my ambition to continue this streak into the second (and final) semester.</p>

<p><strong>Insightful Session on Alberta’s Energy Policy</strong></p>

<p>An intriguing session I attended this week, hosted by the Alberta Chamber of Resources, delved into the Alberta Sovereignty within a United Canada <a href="https://www.alberta.ca/alberta-sovereignty-within-a-united-canada-act#:~:text=The%20Alberta%20Sovereignty%20within%20a%20United%20Canada%20Act%3A,provincial%20jurisdiction%20to%20provincial%20entities" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Act</a> &amp; federal Clean Electricity <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/services/environment/weather/climatechange/climate-plan/clean-electricity-regulation.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Regulations </a>(CER) from a constitutional perspective. The Alberta Sovereignty Act, a significant legislative move by the UCP government, symbolizes a stride toward greater autonomy over resource control and independent energy policy decision-making.</p>

<p>The Act’s provision allowing Alberta to opt-out of federal CER has sparked a lot debate. It raises critical questions about the balance of power in federalism, the effectiveness of the Act, and its implications for Alberta’s economy and environment. This session was a lens into the complex interplay of federal and provincial powers, highlighting the tensions and challenges in policymaking within a federated system.</p>
