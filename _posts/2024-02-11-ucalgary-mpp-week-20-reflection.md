<p><strong>Economy of Data</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In our data and public policy class we discussed the complexity of thinking of social media platforms as a free market of free speech due to the significant financial interests and economic activities. The monetization of user data, which is an extractive resource, highlights a fundamental difference between the use of public spaces or resources and the utilization of digital data. In public spaces like parks, I can find inspiration without the expectation of owing a portion of any resultant ideas or wealth to the entity maintaining the space. However, when public data is used to generate wealth it becomes complicated which suggests a form of indebtedness to the source of that data.</p>

<p>This complexity is further illustrated by the evolving perception of technologies like OpenAI's ChatGPT. Initially, there may have been little contention regarding its development and use, as it was seen as an innovative contribution to society. However, as the potential for substantial financial gain became apparent, stakeholders began to recognize the value of the data and intellectual property involved, leading to legal actions. This shift underscores a growing recognition that data, much like physical resources, holds significant economic value. When entities capitalize on data to generate profit, questions of ownership, compensation, and <strong>fairness </strong>come to the forefront.</p>

<p><strong>Influencing Policy</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>During our PPOL607: Politics and Strategy, a guest speaker delved into the role of influencing policy and politics. The speaker emphasized that the universal impact of climate change necessitates building strong relationships across various sectors to advocate effectively for sound environmental policies. The crux of their message was the critical importance of communication and messaging. By crafting compelling narratives and employing strategic communication techniques, policymakers and advocates can garner support, sway public opinion, and ultimately, drive the implementation of policies that address the urgent and far-reaching consequences of climate change. </p>

<p><strong>Decision Analysis in Public Policy</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In the PPOL609: Decision Analysis lecture, we navigated through concepts essential for policy evaluation and decision-making. We distinguished between current and future values to understand the impact of time (inflation) on monetary worth, emphasizing the importance of discounting future values. We delved into the Net Present Value (NPV) calculations, crucial for evaluating the profitability of investments. The Benefit-Cost Ratio (BCR) formula was explored to assess the economic viability of projects by comparing their benefits to costs. The BCR method measures costs and benefits in terms of proportions rather than in absolute dollar values, which can obscure the full financial implications of the choices at hand. This approach might lead decision-makers to prefer an investment with a higher BCR, even if it offers a significantly lower net benefit in absolute terms compared to an alternative. Therefore, buyer be aware of the evaluation method and the financial risk exposure.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Lastly, we examined the Internal Rate of Return (IRR) formula using Excel, a tool for estimating the profitability of potential investments, rounding off our comprehensive overview of decision analysis in public policy.</p>

<p><strong>Technological Readiness and Public Opinion</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The historical context of the ban on climbing boys in the UK, beginning in 1788, and the subsequent evolution of chimney sweeping practices provides a fascinating lens through which to examine technological, institutional, and behavioral changes over time. Initially, the ban was technologically premature, as mechanical sweeping methods were available until 1790s, and they remained prohibitively expensive until the 1870s. This technological gap meant that, despite the moral and ethical drive to end the dangerous and exploitative practice of employing young boys as chimney sweeps, a practical alternative was not immediately feasible.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Institutionally, the system was entrenched in class distinctions, with housekeepers and master sweepers receiving incentives that perpetuated the use of climbing boys. These incentives, alongside societal behaviors such as sympathy from clients and the benefits derived from tips, helped maintain the status quo until mechanical sweeping technology became affordable and widely adopted, leading to the Chimney Sweepers Act of 1875.</p>

<p>The guest lecturer's in our SEDV633: Energy and Climate Policy discussed public opinion formation regarding climate policy. The comparison between the sociological model and the marketplace model, alongside the agenda-setting hypothesis, underscores the complex interplay between media representation and public perception. This dynamic is particularly relevant in contemporary debates on climate policy, where public opinion can be significantly influenced by how issues are framed and discussed in the media. The lecturer emphasized the importance of critical thinking in evaluating why certain topics gain prominence in public discourse.</p>
