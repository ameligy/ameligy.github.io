<p>I have always enjoyed the Canadian Rockies, so much so that I was driving from Edmonton to Calgary almost bi-weekly in 2020 to get to Canmore/K-Country. In 2022, when I began my rotation in Northern Alberta, I seized the opportunity to move to Calgary. This was possible as my employer at the time, Imperial, operated chartered flights from both Edmonton and Calgary to our work destination.</p>

<p>I am grateful to have been able to discover more of the Rockies during my 2 week off rotation, but I felt my exploration wasn't complete. I also knew that if I were to move from Calgary, a return might not be on the cards. Given that I still have ambitions to climb more <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://stevensong.com/lists/canadian-rockies-11000ers/" target="_blank">11,000ers</a> and explore more hidden gems of the Rockies (refer to my friend's, Cornelius, <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.spectacularmountains.com/" target="_blank">website</a>), I was motivated to stay in Calgary for another year and and look up UCalgary's offerings. I am excited to document my MPP experience on this blog and potentially some of my outdoor adventures on my YouTube <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCzj15jLYlOLKHqxwqMQiULw" target="_blank">channel</a>. </p>

<p>The School of Public Policy (SPP) at UCalgary stood out, owing to its stellar reputation and highly quantitative curriculum, promising an avenue to integrate my engineering background seamlessly (refer to <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="http://atlas101.ca/pm/programs/calgary-spp/" target="_blank">Atlas of Public Management</a>). Additionally, the energy-centric focus of the SPP resonated deeply with me. During my research into various energy topics in 2020 and 2021, I had come across notable publications from the faculty and students here.</p>
